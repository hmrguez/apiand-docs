## Result pattern

Exceptions in C# are expensive to thrown. They introduce a lot of runtime overhead and generally disrupt the flow of the application. That's why nowadays a lot of ASP.NET APIs implement the result pattern.

It consists of instead of possibly throwing an exception, each method returns a result object that contains the result of the operation and any errors that may have occurred. This allows for a more predictable and efficient error handling mechanism.

`Apiand.Extensions` provides with 2 classes to use it correctly `Error` and `Result`.

### Error

The `Error` class is used to represent an error that occurred during the execution of a method.

```csharp
public sealed record Error(string Code, string Description, HttpStatusCode StatusCode = HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);
```

Code is a unique identifier for the specific error like *P-404* or *project-not-found*, description is a human readable description of the error and status code is the HTTP status code that should be returned to the client.

### Result

The `Result` class is used to represent the result of an operation. It contains an optional value of type `T` and an optional error.

```csharp
// Untyped
public class Result
{
    public bool IsSuccess => Error == null;

    public Error? Error { get; protected init; }
}
```

```csharp
// Typed
public class Result<T> : Result
{
    public T? Data { get; private init; }
}
```

The `Result` class has a few methods to help you create results easily:

```csharp
// Untyped
public static Result Succeed()
{
    return new Result<T>
    {
        Error = null
    };
}

// Typed
public static Result<T> Succeed(T data)
{
    return new Result<T>
    {
        Data = data,
        Error = null
    };
}

public static new Result<T> Fail(Error error)
{
    return new Result<T>
    {
        Error = error
    };
}
```

Also with implicit operators to convert from `T` to `Result<T>` and from `Error` to a failed result

## Enumeration pattern

Enums in C# are not descriptive in some situations where the human-readable name might not be the same as the enum name. For example, the `HttpStatusCode` enum has a lot of values that are not descriptive at all like `HttpStatusCode.Continue` or `HttpStatusCode.NotImplemented`, and the names are space-separated, just camel cased.

The Enumeration pattern is a way for you to manually provide a string value to the enum. Since it can't be done directly in C# we need to use classes or records.

```csharp
public record Enumeration(int Id, string Name);
```

The best practice for using Enumerations is having a class that implements it, that would be out "Enum" type, and all the values are static fields of it. For example:

```csharp
public record HttpStatusCode : Enumeration
{
    public static readonly HttpStatusCode Continue = new(100, "Continue");
    public static readonly HttpStatusCode NotImplemented = new(501, "Not Implemented");
}
```

It comes with methods like `FromId<T>` or `FromName<T>` which allow you to get the static member whose Id or Name match the parameter or `GetAll<T>` which returns all the members of the enumeration type.
