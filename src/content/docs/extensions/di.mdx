## Service attribute

The `Service` attribute is used to mark a class as a service that can be injected into other classes. It is part of the dependency injection (DI) system in Apiand and allows for automatic registration and resolution of services.

### Usage

To use the `Service` attribute, simply decorate your class with the `[Service]` attribute. For example:

```csharp
[Service]
public class MyService: IMyService
{
    public void DoSomething()
    {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

Then we have a helper method that scans for every class with the `Service` attribute in a specific assembly and adds the required dependency injection from its parent interface.

```csharp
services.AddServicesWithAttribute(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
```

:::note

Here services refers to an IServiceCollection. If you are using the `Apiand` project template, this is already done for you in either the `Program.cs` file or in a Module (more about it below).

:::

### Scopes

The `Service` attribute allows for a second parameter which defines the scope for which the service will be injected to:

```csharp
[Service(ServiceLifetimeType.Singleton)]
...

[Service(ServiceLifetimeType.Transient)]
...

[Service(ServiceLifetimeType.Scoped)]
...
```

It uses `Scoped` by default

## Module

A module is a class that contains the DI configuration for a specific part of your application. It is used to group related services together and can be registered with the DI container, ideally located in each project of your solution.

```csharp
public interface IModule
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Configures the application builder for the module, including services, logging, etc.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="builder">Generally the WebApplicationBuilder the program starts with</param>
    /// <param name="configuration">The application configuration</param>
    void ConfigureWebAppBuilder(IHostApplicationBuilder builder, IConfiguration configuration);

    /// <summary>
    /// Configures the middleware and request pipeline for the module.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="app">The application builder to configure the request pipeline.</param>
    void ConfigureApplication(IApplicationBuilder app);

    /// <summary>
    /// Registers any module-specific mappings, such as AutoMapper profiles.
    /// </summary>
    void RegisterMappings();

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the name of the module for logging and diagnostics.
    /// </summary>
    string Name { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the priority of the module for ordering. Lower numbers load first.
    /// </summary>
    int Order { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Determines whether the module is enabled based on the configuration.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="configuration">The application configuration.</param>
    /// <returns>True if the module is enabled; otherwise, false.</returns>
    bool IsEnabled(IConfiguration configuration);
}
```

:::caution

For future versions we are going to provide with a clean method for adding all modules in your solution but for now you will need to do it manually

If you want an example check the Program.cs file for the API in the DDD template
