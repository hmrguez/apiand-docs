title: generate service
---

The `generate service` command adds service components to an existing Apiand project.

## Usage

```bash
apiand generate service <name> [options]
```

## Examples

Generate a service:
```bash
apiand generate service UserService
```

## Behaviors

- `DDD`: Generates a service interface in the Application layer and a service implementation in the Infrastructure layer; DI is done automagically with the `Service` attribute.

- `Standalone`: Creates both the service interface and implementation in the same `Entity/path` folder (where 'path' is derived from the service name). For example, if the service name is `User.Auth`, the files will be created in the `Entity/User` folder.

- `SingleLayer`: Same as Standalone - creates both interface and implementation files in the `Entity/path` folder based on the service name structure.
