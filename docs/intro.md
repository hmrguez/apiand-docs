# Talk about Apiand

Apiand is a CLI tool that helps you create projects from templates. It is designed to be extensible and easy to use. It is built on top of the .NET Core platform and uses the System.CommandLine library to handle command-line arguments.

If you want to get started with Apiand, you can follow the [installation guide](./getting-started/installing-apiand.md). If you want to learn how to create your own templates, you can follow the [collaboration guide](./collaborate/add-templates.md).
